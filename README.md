In this repository i keep all the shell scripts made by me for the Linux operating system.

## YoutubeDLSS
Is a custom shell script made to download youtube videos and/or convert them to mp3, and even allows you to play them back with the use of various programs. YoutubeDLSS makes the download of a video simple and easy without the use of legthy commands. A command line first timer could download a video easily and browse through youtube. <br /> This and more, a script away. Just try it yourself.

## TermWeather
Is the ultimate tool to get weather reports and other advanced weather info like (metographs and geo-info) of your own favourite locations in a gify. Its simple 0 commands, instant results from various forecast sources. All at once or one by one.

## FasterTMUX
Is a simple script for tmux. Not too special but saves you the hustle of pane creation positioning. It opens you the tmux clock imediatly and also the amount of panes you would personally like. Simple but convinient.

#### Requirements: tmux

## TKill
Is a tmux session killer. After all the frequent freezes and exahaustion of typing "exit" on every pane or the multi-shortcut way, I decided to create a shell script that kills all tmux session and list what sessions and panes are about to die. just a single line and everything is dead 100% no freezes no bugs, simple.

#### Requirements: tmux

## My Tmux Config Files
I decided to upload my tmux configuration files as well in case someone is interested to use them. They allow you to change windows using the mouse and resize them as well and they also have custom shortcuts (mainly uses ctrl+a). They have a custom color theme and i even uploaded a different config that makes tmux look like a windows 95 bios interface.
